Description: fast.adonis is a computationally efficient nonparametric multivariate analysis of microbiome data for large-scale studies. This code generates results consistent with adonis/adonis2 but much faster. For complex sampling studies, fast.adonis integrates sampling weight algebraically without replicating samples to mimic the source population; thus, analysis can be completed much faster without requiring a large amount of memory.
